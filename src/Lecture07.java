        // SELF-CHECK PROBLEMS:
        // Note: you may need to put some of your answers inside comments

        // Put your answer for #8 here:
        // A Call stack is a data structure that operates on the Last in First out principle.
        // It relates to recursion by unwinding after all the calls have been pushed sequentially on to the stack.

        // Put your answer for #9 here:
        // This is a matter of printing before or after the recursive call. After each line is read,
        // it is immediately printed. There is no reversal, the recursion just reads the line and prints.

        // Put your answer for #10 here:
        // The method is recursively stacking the lines, after checking if there is a line, until there are no more.
        // Then, because the print is after the recursion, the stack unwinds printing from last to first.

        // Put your answer for #11 here:
        // There is no base case, it doesn't handle the edge case of y = 0
        // It can be fixed by adding an if statement for y = 0
